# Habitability-of-Exoplanets-Infosys-SpringBoard
🌍 Habitability of Exoplanets – Data Analysis & Feature Engineering Project

The Habitability of Exoplanets project focuses on analyzing confirmed exoplanet data to assess their potential habitability using planetary and host star characteristics.
The project applies data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis techniques to derive meaningful indices such as a Habitability Score Index and a Stellar Compatibility Index, making the dataset ready for further machine learning or scientific analysis.

This project demonstrates a complete data preprocessing pipeline, from raw astronomical data to ML-ready features.

🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess real-world exoplanet data

- Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries

- Encode categorical features for numerical analysis

- Engineer scientifically motivated habitability-related features

- Normalize features for machine learning readiness

- Validate data quality using statistics and visualizations
